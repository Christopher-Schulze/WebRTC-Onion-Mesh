# WebRTC-based Onion Routing Mesh Network

This project implements a peer-to-peer overlay network that combines WebRTC for efficient data transmission with onion routing for enhanced privacy. The network is designed to be resilient and scalable while maintaining strong privacy guarantees through multi-hop traffic encryption.

## Core Components

*   **WebRTC Transport Layer:** Leverages WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer communication, enabling efficient data transfer with low latency. WebRTC's NAT traversal capabilities help establish connections even behind restrictive network configurations.

*   **Onion Routing Network:** Implements a multi-hop routing system where traffic is encrypted in layers, similar to the Tor network, ensuring that no single node can determine both the source and destination of communications.

*   **WebPush Integration:** Enables connection establishment in restricted network environments by leveraging WebPush notifications for peer discovery and connection initiation.

*   **Onion Routing:** Implements multi-hop routing with Sphinx packet format, ensuring that no single node can determine both the source and destination of traffic.

*   **Self-Healing Capabilities:** Includes mechanisms for automatic detection and recovery from node failures or network disruptions to maintain network availability.

*   **Data Distribution:** Uses chunk-based distribution and multi-path routing to improve performance and resilience against network failures.

*   **WebAssembly Support:** Can be compiled to WebAssembly for browser-based deployment, allowing for broader accessibility without requiring additional client software.

*   **Decentralized Architecture:** Operates without central servers, with network resilience increasing as more nodes participate.

*   **Advanced Security:** Implements quantum-resistant cryptography and includes measures to resist traffic analysis through steganography and traffic shaping techniques.

## Project Status

This is a Proof of Concept implementation in Rust. Core components are in various stages of development, with some features marked as `unimplemented!` or containing `TODO` placeholders in the codebase.

## Getting Started

Detailed setup and usage instructions will be provided as the project matures.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome from those interested in privacy-preserving technologies and network engineering. The project is implemented in Rust, and developers familiar with networking protocols and cryptography are particularly encouraged to participate.
