# Decentralized Privacy Network

This project implements a peer-to-peer overlay network with a focus on privacy and security. It builds upon established anonymity principles while incorporating modern web technologies for improved accessibility and performance.

## Core Components

*   **Overlay Network Architecture:** Implements a virtual network on top of existing internet infrastructure, enabling flexible routing and enhanced privacy through traffic obfuscation.

*   **WebRTC Transport Layer:** Utilizes WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) for data transmission, providing low-latency connections. WebRTC traffic blends with standard web traffic, making it more resistant to detection and blocking.

*   **WebPush Integration:** Enables connection establishment in restricted network environments by leveraging WebPush notifications for peer discovery and connection initiation.

*   **Onion Routing:** Implements multi-hop routing with Sphinx packet format, ensuring that no single node can determine both the source and destination of traffic.

*   **Self-Healing Capabilities:** Includes mechanisms for automatic detection and recovery from node failures or network disruptions to maintain network availability.

*   **Data Distribution:** Uses chunk-based distribution and multi-path routing to improve performance and resilience against network failures.

*   **WebAssembly Support:** Can be compiled to WebAssembly for browser-based deployment, allowing for broader accessibility without requiring additional client software.

*   **Decentralized Architecture:** Operates without central servers, with network resilience increasing as more nodes participate.

*   **Advanced Security:** Implements quantum-resistant cryptography and includes measures to resist traffic analysis through steganography and traffic shaping techniques.

## Project Status

This is a Proof of Concept implementation in Rust. Core components are in various stages of development, with some features marked as `unimplemented!` or containing `TODO` placeholders in the codebase.

## Getting Started

Detailed setup and usage instructions will be provided as the project matures.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome from those interested in privacy-preserving technologies and network engineering. The project is implemented in Rust, and developers familiar with networking protocols and cryptography are particularly encouraged to participate.
